recently I'm obsessed with dopamine detox

which I think I know for a very long time from minimalist youtubers

and I do try some but haven't try seriously

I'm actually awake but sometimes I crawl back to my comfort cave

but recently I found that my ability to focus doing something hard become less and less effective

actually one of my biggest strength is I can be super focus for no reason

but the dopamine consumption makes me weak

and there's nothing good or bad, it's just the way you try to live your life

so there's two things for myself:

1. delete social media app from my phone 1 by 1

originally I've had very few apps installed on my phone

but I will sometimes scrolling social media and spend hours just scrolling

which isn't bad, you kinda think this is very common things to do as a modern leisure time

but, if almost all the people are doing it, doesn't mean it's right

is just means lots of ppl doing it.

so i delete social media periodically, making sure I don't miss important stuff

2. try to exercise more

I mainly do morning run recently like within a month

I did make myself rest more this year by not attending taipei marathon

loose the nerve for years, I like to get better than myself

so the pressure came from myself

I don't want myself become very stressful when I need to chase lots of goals and lose focus on the most important things

I made myself a gap year lol

and probably I'll have more energy on more things next year

more goals and more action and building

that would be great.

so the chess thing also become my daily routine

train my thinking, some days are good, some days are bad

but by doing everyday

I feel better everyday

so as wake up early and do morning runs and getting more focused.

I always wish that I can do more

but actually I need to do less

less is more.
