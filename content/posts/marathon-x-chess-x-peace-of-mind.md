for the past few months, i've been doing things that make me happy.

not the fancy things, just trying to cook, water and grow some random plants.

read some e-books, playing PC games, build my game room etc etc.

I didn't went to taipei marathon this year, which I do it every year

one of the strategic reason is that I can get age cut-off for boston marathon next year

and the other thing is that the running is actually the way that I used for relax, not the pressure that I gave myself.

of course I want to do better and have my goal as a sub-3 runner

and I'm pretty sure that I can do it (lol)

but I also wanted to learn more things in this AI era, build more things with my business

or just enjoy life without any reason.

all the things take time, I couldn't do intensive training if the priority isn't the first one.

It will become very painful and meaningless.

when it comes to utilize more time, I think I'm start getting used to "waste" time on the things I loved.

which I think is very lucky.

Because not everyone can find things that can excite them, and I can always find things that can make me obsessed.

aside from reading, it's chess this year.

for the rapid, I go from elo 400, down to 300, and went back to 800 recently.

not a very impressive elo but I like the feeling of getting better at something every day.

that makes me feel like I'm doing the training of brain.

and I can do almost anywhere as long as I have a phone and some time.

I like the classic things that can last for a very long time.

chess is a good thinking game.

Most of the time, this world tell us: don't waste time, do something valuable, earn more money and get a better job.

but we're not happy if you aren't doing things that makes you happy.

Happy is the remedy.

I learn this from my beloved one.

And i'm practicing this as my first priority task.

you don't need to impress even yourself all the time.

just do something that you like or want.

the right moment will come.

the right thing will come to you.

it's almost inevitable to happen.

you're the main character of this world.

other people are like NPC.

2025 is like a magical year to myself

I think i've been doing great things throughout the year, 

and cut off things that I don't like, seldom used like a huge cleanup of life

the time that I enjoyed, is the day that I do things with my willpower

the action that you decide by yourself, is the things that you won't ever regret.

the gratefulness and the beautiful terms are like common old sayings

simple and clear.

I'll probably keep doing things that I love

and enjoy the life that I have right now

I think in this modern society, we overestimate the glory achievement that others made

and we underestimate the potential that we can made by ourselves in every day life.

I think that's not the reason I try to quit social media

but because I want to take back of my time

doing things that I love, enjoy the times that I wasted.

and probably, I want to spend more time with my family in general
