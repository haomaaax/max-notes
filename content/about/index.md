# Hi, I'm Max 👋

I'm a runner, chess player, and builder who believes in doing things that make me happy.

## What I Write About

- **Running & Marathon** - My journey as a runner, training insights, and the philosophy of endurance
- **Chess** - Learning chess from scratch, improving from 300 to 800+ ELO, and the joy of getting better every day
- **AI & Technology** - Building tools, exploring AI, and staying curious in this evolving era
- **Life Philosophy** - Minimalism, dopamine detox, focus, and finding peace in everyday moments

## My Approach

I don't write to impress. I write to think, reflect, and share honest thoughts about life. Most of what this world tells us - work harder, earn more, don't waste time - misses the point. Happiness is the remedy.

I'm learning that:
- Less is more
- Doing things you love isn't wasting time
- Getting better at something every day feels amazing
- You don't need to impress even yourself all the time

## Currently

- 🏃‍♂️ Morning runs, aiming for Boston Marathon qualification
- ♟️ Playing chess daily (rapid ~800 ELO and climbing)
- 💻 Building with AI, growing my blog, exploring new ideas
- 📚 Reading, cooking, growing plants, enjoying simple things
